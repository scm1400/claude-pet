## What is this?

Claude Mama is a tiny desktop widget that monitors your [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview) API usage and reacts with the emotional range of a Korean mother who just found out you skipped dinner.

- **Using too little?** She's angry. She didn't raise you to waste a perfectly good API quota.
- **Using a moderate amount?** She's worried. The neighbors' kids are using more.
- **Using a healthy amount?** She's happy. Finally, some return on investment.
- **Maxing it out?** She's proud. Tears are streaming. Chicken is being ordered.

> *"Other moms worry their kids use too much computer. Claude Mama worries you don't use enough."*

## Features

- **Real-time usage tracking** — Pulls 7-day and 5-hour utilization from the Anthropic OAuth API, with smart JSONL session fallback when rate limited
- **Pixel art character** — A pixel-art mama with curler hair and 6 mood expressions (angry, worried, happy, proud, confused, sleeping)
- **Guilt-powered messages** — Randomized mom-style messages that rotate every 2 minutes
- **5-hour burnout warning** — "Take a break~ You're almost at the limit!" (she cares, in her own way)
- **Share Report Card** — Save a shareable PNG card with your current mood, usage stats, and reset countdown
- **Quote Collection (도감)** — Collect 86 unique mama quotes across 4 rarity tiers (Common, Rare, Legendary, Secret)
- **System tray** — Lives quietly in your taskbar, judging you silently
- **Settings panel** — Position, auto-start, language selection, and collection viewer
- **4 languages** — 한국어, English, 日本語, 中文
- **Auto-start** — Boots with your OS so you can never escape mom's watchful eye
- **Auto-update** — Mom keeps herself up to date via GitHub Releases

### Share Report Card

Save your current mama status as a PNG image — perfect for sharing on social media.

The card includes mood, quote, 7-day/5-hour usage bars with reset countdowns, and a UTC timestamp.

### Quote Collection

Mama has 86 unique quotes spread across 4 rarity tiers:

| Rarity | Count | How to Unlock |
|--------|------:|---------------|
| ⚪ Common | 73 | Displayed during normal use |
| 🔵 Rare | 5 | Hit specific usage milestones (0%, 50%, 100% of 5hr, etc.) |
| 🟡 Legendary | 3 | Achieve streaks and lifetime milestones |
| 🔴 Secret | 5 | Use the app on holidays or at 3 AM |

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview) must be installed and logged in (OAuth)
- That's it. Mom doesn't ask for much.

### Download

Grab the latest installer from [**Releases**](https://github.com/scm1400/claude-mama/releases):

| Platform | File | Arch |
|----------|------|------|
| Windows | `Claude Mama Setup x.x.x.exe` | x64 |
| macOS | `Claude Mama-x.x.x.dmg` | Universal (Intel + Apple Silicon) |

> **⚠️ Not code-signed:** Claude Mama is not code-signed yet, so your OS will show a security warning on first install.
> - **Windows:** SmartScreen will say "Windows protected your PC." Click **More info** → **Run anyway**.
> - **macOS:** You'll see "cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified." Go to **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security** → **Open Anyway**.

### First Launch

1. Make sure Claude Code is installed and logged in (`claude` in terminal)
2. Claude Mama will automatically detect your API usage via OAuth
3. If rate-limited (429), it falls back to local JSONL session parsing — no extra config needed
4. Mama starts polling every 5 minutes. Just let her do her thing.

### Auto-Start & Auto-Update

- **Auto-start:** Enabled by default. Claude Mama starts with your OS. Toggle in Settings if you dare.
- **Auto-update:** Updates are downloaded automatically from GitHub Releases. When a new version is ready, mama will ask you to restart.

```

1. **Polls** the Anthropic usage API every 5 minutes
2. **Falls back to JSONL session parsing** when rate limited (429) — scans `~/.claude/projects/` session files to estimate usage with dynamic calibration
3. **Computes mood** based on weekly utilization thresholds
4. **Renders** a pixel-art mama character with mood-appropriate expression and message
5. **Nags you** until you use your tokens like a responsible adult

### Mood Thresholds

| Weekly Usage | Mood | Mom Says |
|:---:|:---:|---|
| 0–14% | 😡 Angry | "Your quota is rotting away!" |
| 15–49% | 😟 Worried | "Mom is worried about you..." |
| 50–84% | 😊 Happy | "Now that's what I like~" |
| 85–100% | 🥹 Proud | "Perfect! I'm tearing up..." |
| 5hr > 90% | ⚠️ Warning | "Take a break~ 5-hour limit almost reached!" |
| Rate limited | 😵 Confused | Uses local session data, or "Collecting data..." while calibrating |
| API error | 😵 Confused | "Something went wrong..." |
| No login | 😴 Sleeping | "Log in first!" |

> **Note:** The Claude Code usage API (`api/oauth/usage`) has strict rate limits. When rate limited (429), Claude Mama parses local session JSONL files (`~/.claude/projects/`) to estimate usage. It learns the token-to-percent ratio from successful API responses (dynamic calibration), so estimates improve over time. While waiting for the first successful calibration, mama shows "Collecting data..." and retries every 10 seconds.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I hide from Claude Mama?**
A: No. She auto-starts with your OS. You can disable it in settings, but she'll know.

**Q: Why does she speak Korean by default?**
A: Because Korean moms are the gold standard of guilt-tripping. You can switch to English, Japanese, or Chinese in settings if your guilt receptors are calibrated differently.

**Q: My usage is at 0% but I've been coding all day?**
A: Make sure Claude Code is logged in. Mom can't monitor what she can't see.

**Q: How do I unlock secret quotes?**
A: Use the app on holidays (New Year, Chuseok, Christmas) or stay up coding past 3 AM. Mom notices everything.

**Q: Is this a joke?**
A: The guilt is real. The chicken reward is not (yet).

**Q: Will there be a Claude Dad version?**
A: Claude Dad went out for tokens and never came back.
